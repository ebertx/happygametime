### WWII obsession

Growing up being obsessed with WWII, I read books, played games, watched movies, in short, absorbed anything I could find that would immerse me in that world.  Strategy games in particular allowed me to experience the sweeping history of such an interesting and formative event.

Although my obsession with WWII has faded a bit, I still find myself periodically drawn into it.  I've tried a handful of WWII strategy games, but the last few I've tried have either had too steep a learning curve or have required too much time to get into (I'm looking at you Hearts of Iron III).

After a strong recommendation for Unity of Command from Tom Chick and a serendipitous Steam sale, I dived into the game not knowing too much about it.

After getting stomped by the Russians a few times, I finally started to wrap my head around it.  The rules of the game are simple, but it has a lot of nuance.  And that nuance centers around supply lines, namely cutting off your enemy's supply lines and protecting your own.  Other games have supply lines, too, but Unity of Command adds a bit more depth by having those supply lines follow railways, bridges, etc.

The game doesn't have a ton of atmosphere.  However, it does have depth, polish, and is fun to play.  I still suck at the game, but it's compelling enough to make me want to get better at it.
